## Features

### Header and Navigation

### Header and Navigation

- The **navigation bar** is located at the top of the page. The logo, positioned in the left corner, serves as a link to the home page and appears on all pages.
- On the top-right, you'll find links to the **Home**, **Gallery**, and **Sign-Up** pages. On smaller devices, the navigation changes to a **hamburger menu** for a more compact and user-friendly experience.
- The navigation is designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the pages.
- The **header** also links to the home page. The active page is indicated by an underline beneath the corresponding navigation link.
- The custom font **"Original Surfer"** was selected to create a fun, easy-going atmosphere, which aligns well with the websiteâ€™s surfing theme.
